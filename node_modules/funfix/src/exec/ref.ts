/**
 * `DynamicRef` provides a binding mechanism where the current value is
 * found through dynamic scope, but where access to the variable itself is
 * resolved through static scope.
 *
 * The current value can be retrieved with the {@link DynamicRef.get} method.
 * New values should be pushed using the {@link DynamicRef.bind} method.
 *
 * Values pushed via `bind` only stay valid while its second argument,
 * a parameterless function (the `thunk`), executes. When that thunk finishes
 * execution, the reference reverts to the previous value.
 *
 * See {@link DynamicRef.bind} for a usage sample.
