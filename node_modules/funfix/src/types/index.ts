/**
 * Module implementing type classes, inspired by Haskell's standard
 * library and by [Typelevel Cats]{@link http://typelevel.org/cats/}.
 *
 * Exports sub-modules:
 *
 * - [types/eq]{@link "types/eq"}: exposes the {@link Eq} type class
 * - [types/functor]{@link "types/functor"}: exposes the {@link Functor}
 *   type class
 * - [types/applicative]{@link "types/applicative"}: exposes the
 *   {@link Apply}, {@link Applicative} and {@link ApplicativeError}
 *   type classes
 * - [types/monad]{@link "types/monad"}: exposes the
 *   {@link FlatMap}, {@link Monad} and {@link MonadError}
 *   type classes
 *
 * Ã€ la carte imports work, assuming an ECMAScript 2015 compatible environment,
 * including ES2015 modules and `import` syntax:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Monad } from "funfix/dist/types"
 * // ... or ...
 * import { Monad } from "funfix"
 * ```
 *
 * In absence of ES2015 compatibility, you can still rely on working with the
 * packaged (`pkg.main`) universal distribution that works within all browsers
 * and environments.
