/**
 * The `Functor` is a type class providing the `map` operation that
 * allows lifting an `f` function into the functor context and
 * applying it.
 *
 * The name is short for "covariant functor".
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const F = functorOf(Option)
 *
 * F.map(Some(1), x => x + 1) // Some(2)
 * ```
 *
 * MUST obey the laws defined in {@link FunctorLaws}.
 *
 * ## Implementation notes
 *
 * Even though in TypeScript the Funfix library is using `abstract class` to
 * express type classes, when implementing this type class it is recommended
 * that you implement it as a mixin using "`implements`", instead of extending
 * it directly with "`extends`". See
 * [TypeScript: Mixins]{@link https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/mixins.html}
 * for details and note that we already have {@link applyMixins} defined.
 *
 * Implementation example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { HK, Functor, registerTypeClassInstance } from "funfix"
 *
 * class Box<T> implements HK<Box<any>, T> {
 *   constructor(public value: T) {}
 *
 *   // Implements HK<Box<any>, A>, not really needed, but useful in order
 *   // to avoid type casts. Note these can and should be undefined:
 *   readonly _funKindF: Box<any>
 *   readonly _funKindA: T
 * }
 *
 * // Type alias defined for readability
 * type BoxK<T> = HK<Box<any>, T>
 *
 * // Actual implementation
 * class BoxFunctor implements Functor<Box<any>> {
 *   map<A, B>(fa: BoxK<A>, f: (a: A) => B): Box<B> {
 *     const a = (fa as Box<A>).value
 *     return new Box(f(a))
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Registering global Functor instance for Box
 * registerTypeClassInstance(Functor)(Box, new BoxFunctor())
 * ```
 *
 * We are using `implements` in order to support multiple inheritance and to
 * avoid inheriting any `static` members. In the Flow definitions (e.g.
 * `.js.flow` files) for Funfix these type classes are defined with
 * "`interface`", as they are meant to be interfaces that sometimes have
 * default implementations and not classes.
 *
 * ## Credits
 *
 * This type class is inspired by the equivalent in Haskell's
 * standard library and the implementation is inspired by the
 * [Typelevel Cats]{@link http://typelevel.org/cats/} project.
