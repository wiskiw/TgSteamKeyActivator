 * The `Eq` is a type class used to determine equality between 2
 * instances of the same type. Any 2 instances `x` and `y` are equal
 * if `eqv(x, y)` is `true`. Moreover, `eqv` should form an
 * equivalence relation.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const F = eqOf(Option)
 *
 * F.eqv(Some(1), Some(1)) // true
 * F.eqv(Some(1), None)    // false
 * ```
 *
 * MUST obey the laws defined in {@link EqLaws}.
 *
 * CREDITS: this type class is inspired by the equivalent in Haskell's
 * standard library and the implementation is inspired by the
 * [Typelevel Cats]{@link http://typelevel.org/cats/} project.
