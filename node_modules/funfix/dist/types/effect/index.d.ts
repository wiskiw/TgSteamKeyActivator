/**
 * The `effect` sub-module of Funfix is about exposing data types that allow
 * for suspending and dealing with side effects.
 *
 * Exports sub-modules:
 *
 * - [effect/eval]{@link "effect/eval"} for the {@link Eval} data type
 *
 * Ã€ la carte imports work, assuming an ECMAScript 2015 compatible environment,
 * including ES2015 modules and `import` syntax:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Eval } from "funfix/dist/effect"
 * // ... or ...
 * import { Eval } from "funfix"
 * ```
 *
 * In absence of ES2015 compatibility, you can still rely on working with the
 * packaged (`pkg.main`) universal distribution that works within all browsers
 * and environments.
