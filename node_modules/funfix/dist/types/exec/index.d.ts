/**
 * The `exec` package contains low level utilities and data types, providing a
 * standard library that is needed for building higher level concurrency tools.
 *
 * Exports sub-modules:
 *
 * - [exec/cancelable](./exec_cancelable.html) for the {@link Cancelable} data type
 * - [exec/scheduler](./exec_scheduler.html) for the {@link Scheduler} type
 * - [exec/time](./exec_time.html) for expressing time durations with
 *   {@link TimeUnit} and {@link Duration}
 * - [exec/future](./exec_future.html) exposes a {@link Future} data type that
 *   is lawful and cancelable, as an alternative to JavaScript's `Promise`
 *
 * Ã€ la carte imports work, assuming an ECMAScript 2015 compatible environment,
 * including ES2015 modules and `import` syntax:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Cancelable } from "funfix/dist/exec"
 * // ... or ...
 * import { Cancelable } from "funfix"
 * ```
 *
 * In absence of ES2015 compatibility, you can still rely on working with the
 * packaged (`pkg.main`) universal distribution that works within all browsers
 * and environments.
 *
 * @module exec
